Hands-on mlflow practice

I created a notebook to practice logging model parameters, metrics, and the model itself using MLflow. 
This helped me understand how to effectively track and manage experiments with MLflow.

This repository includes:
<ul>
    <li>A Jupyter Notebook: <code>ml_flow_binary_classification.ipynb</code></li>
    <li>A screenshot of the MLflow UI</li>
    <li>A screenshot showing the command used to launch MLflow on the local machine</li>
</ul>
